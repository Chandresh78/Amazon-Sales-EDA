# Amazon Sales Report

## Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Amazon sales data. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal of this project is to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance on the Amazon platform.

## Project Structure

- **AmazonSalesReport.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset(s) used for the analysis.
- **images/**: Directory containing plots and visualizations generated from the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

## Requirements

To run the analysis, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains sales data from Amazon, including information such as product ID, product category, sales date, price, quantity sold, and customer reviews.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loading the dataset and performing basic data cleaning tasks, such as handling missing values and removing duplicates.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating summary statistics to understand the distribution of the data, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.

3. **Sales Trends**: Analyzing sales trends over time, including monthly and yearly sales performance.

4. **Customer Behavior**: Examining customer behavior patterns, such as the most purchased products and the frequency of purchases.

5. **Product Performance**: Identifying top-performing products based on sales volume and revenue.

6. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to illustrate key findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Key Findings

- Sales tend to peak during specific months, indicating a seasonal trend.
- Certain product categories consistently outperform others in terms of sales volume and revenue.
- Customer reviews and ratings have a significant impact on sales.

## Usage

To run the analysis, simply open the `AmazonSalesReport.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment and execute the cells sequentially.
